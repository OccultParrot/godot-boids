# Godot Boids

This is a simple implementation of the boids algorythm written for Godot!

HUGE help from [this](https://vanhunteradams.com/Pico/Animal_Movement/Boids-algorithm.html#Separation) paper! Check it out!

I wanna mess around with converting it to C# because godot supports that and it sounds fun!
